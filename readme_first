Configure/Complie Attention Plzzz:
Make sure that the current python environment can run phonopy and thirdorder!!!
Make sure the vaspkit can be called directly in the current environment!!!
Edit the Config.sh according to the guide.
Then bash configure.sh.And you will get the BatchX1_template.sh which is suit for you.
Also you will get a "template" directory,you can copy this one for your every project every times. 
Directy run bash/nohup command in the directory BatchX1.sh exsited!

Usage Attention Plzzz:
1. Do not place POSCAR and POTCAR files in the pr folder.
2. All the material structures that need to be calculated are placed in POSCARs in the form of a file,
which does not need to be named, but does not have the same name.
3. BatchX can automatically identify and classify the material as it is calculating.
4. In the optimization and self-consistent period, the KPOINT Setting is performed with auccracy 0.2 Monkhorst-Pack Scheme through VASPKIT.
5. SuperCell Rule based on reasonable empirical method, and it will show on the fileneme, like SIFC-222 TIFC-333.

commands like:
nohup bash /home/user1/BatchProject1/BatchX1_template.sh > logfile.log 2>&1 & echo $!
bash BatchX1_template > logfile.log 2>&1 & echo $!
