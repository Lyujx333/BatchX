# BatchX
This is a program that can perform automated batch calculations of thermal conductivity based on DFT(VASP).Based on programs such as VASP, VASPKIT, ShengBTE, Phonopy, and thirdorder. It only requires inputting an unoptimized initial structure(POSCAR) and a command, and it can automatically invoke the user's PBS cluster for computation.
